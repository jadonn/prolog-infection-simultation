This program is designed to simulate a terrorist attack using an infections disease. In this simulation, the attack occurs in a population of 2000 individuals. These individuals are in contact with each other through families, neighborhoods, and other mixing groups.

The program can be started using the normal SWIProlog interpreter by consulting the main source file and then executing the command "go.". This will initialize the scenario and the main scenario menu.

This program was written on Windows 10 in Notepad++. Linux users experiencing issues should consider taking the appropriate steps to run source code files on Unix operating systems.

The exact formula for calculating the different risks of contamination and infection were unfortunately unable to be implemented by the project submission deadline due to insufficient available information. The rest of the major functionality of the program should be implemented, using placeholder values in place of the formulas for calculating random score values.

The results and totals recorded during the simulation will be output to simulation.txt in the directory where the Prolog interpreter is initialized.
